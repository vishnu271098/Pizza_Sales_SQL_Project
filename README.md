# 🍕 Pizza Sales SQL Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview
This project explores a Pizza Sales dataset using SQL queries.  
The goal is to demonstrate analytical SQL skills — from basic aggregations to advanced window functions, ranking, and revenue analysis.

The queries are divided into chapters (like tasks), and each one highlights different SQL concepts commonly used in real business analysis.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Load the dataset into your SQL environment (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, or SQLite).  
2. Open the `.sql` files in the `queries/` folder.  
3. Run the queries sequentially to reproduce the results.  
4. Optionally, save results into `results/` folder as `.csv` or view them directly in your SQL client.
